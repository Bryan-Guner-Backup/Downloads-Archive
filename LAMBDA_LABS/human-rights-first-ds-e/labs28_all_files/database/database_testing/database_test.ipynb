Police fire tear gas and riot rounds at protesters during the arrests. Protesters become agitated.  After police walk arrestee away protesters continue to shout at police. Police respond with a second bout of tear gas and riot rounds.  A racial slur can be heard shouted although it is unsure who is shouting.   \n",

The protesters followed the police outside the Capitol and one of the protesters blocked their path and later the crowd tried to pull the arrestees from the custody of the police officers. That is when more crowds and police started to get involved. Police used pepper spray to help disperse the crowd and arrested 17 people including two juveniles.</td>\n      <td>['arrest', 'beat', 'child', 'less-lethal', 'pepper-spray', 'protester', 'spray', 'tackle']</td>\n      <td>{'lat': '41.5868353', 'long': '-93.6249593'}</td>\n      <td>Police arrest 17 people during a peaceful protest for Black Lives Matter at the State Capitol</td>\n      <td>2020-07-01</td>\n      <td>July 1st</td>\n      <td>ia-desmoines-8</td>\n      <td>41.586835</td>\n      <td>-93.624959</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1177</th>\n      <td>1177</td>\n      <td>['https://twitter.com/DJPAIMON/status/1268399580753858561', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwx86v/another_angle_of_the_police_firing_upon_us/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwml8n/state_police_gassing_citizens/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwaqzx/from_a_facebook_livestreamseems_like_peaceful/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/gwc763/iowa_city_pd_gassed_and_flashbanged_their_own/']</td>\n      <td>Iowa</td>\n      <td>Iowa City</td>\n      <td>State police shoot tear gas into and deploy flashbangs against a crowd of peaceful protesters attempting to enter I-80.
