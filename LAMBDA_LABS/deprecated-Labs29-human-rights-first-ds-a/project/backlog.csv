jr8moq,Wisconsin,Kenosha,2020-11-09 00:00:00,REPORT: Kenosha man charged with illegally buying gun for Kyle Rittenhouse,"KENOSHA COUNTY (WQOW) - The man who purchased the gun Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly used in shootings that killed two in Kenosha earlier this year is now facing charges and court documents show the gun was bought in Ladysmith.

Dominick Black, 19, is charged with two counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 causing death.

According to the criminal complaint filed in Kenosha County Court:

Black purchased a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle from Ladysmith Ace Home Center up in Ladysmith on May 1, 2020.

The complaint says Black bought the gun with money from Rittenhouse with the intention of giving the gun to him.

Rittenhouse was 17 at the time and thus not of legal age to buy a gun in Wisconsin.

Rittenhouse and Black agreed the gun would be stored at Black's stepfather's home in Kenosha. The address of that home matches the address listed for Black on the criminal complaint.

On August 23, Jacob Blake was shot in Kenosha which led to protests and riots in the city.

During those events, Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two people and wounded another. He is charged with 1st degree intentional homicide, 1st degree reckless homicide, two counts of 1st degree recklessly endangering safety and one count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.

Rittenhouse's attorneys have argued he was acting in self defense.

If convicted, Rittenhouse could spend the rest of his life in prison.

jr96g0,New York,New York,2020-11-09 20:32:57+00:00,Feds: NYPD officer served as lookout for cocaine ring,"NEW YORK (AP) — Federal authorities arrested a New York City police officer Monday on charges he served as a lookout for drug traffickers who smuggled hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the United States.

Officer Amaury Abreu, 34, of Hauppauge, is accused of explaining law enforcement methods to the drug ring and performing warrant checks on its members.

Federal prosecutors said he also distributed cocaine and traveled to the Dominican Republic in January and February to meet with leaders of the trafficking group.

“Today I’m going to find out the thing I couldn’t yesterday because there were too many people at the office,” Abreu said in one message to the traffickers, according to court records.

Abreu was charged with conspiring to import and distribute cocaine and released Monday on $1 million bond. A message was sent to his defense attorney seeking comment.

Abreu has been with the NYPD nine years and is suspended without pay, the Police Department said.

Seth DuCharme, the Brooklyn U.S. attorney, said in a statement that Abreu “disgraced his NYPD badge and betrayed the public trust as well as fellow members of law enforcement who put their lives on the line to interdict drugs that endanger our communities.”

Federal prosecutors also charged two high-ranking members of the New York-based group and the owner of a Long Island produce company accused of receiving cocaine concealed in cardboard tomato boxes.

Authorities said the ring also relied on help from a corrupt U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer to escort drug shipments through customs and baggage claim at John F.

jrvshi,Georgia,Dallas,2020-11-09 21:46:46+00:00,Woman posing as FBI agent demands free fast food,"ROCKMART, Ga. (AP) — Police have jailed a woman in Georgia accused of pretending to be an FBI agent to score a free fast-food meal, saying she allegedly threatened to arrest restaurant workers if they didn’t serve her a complimentary bite.

Kimberly Ragsdale, 47, of Dallas, was charged Thursday with impersonating a public officer following repeated attempts to get free meals at a Chick-Fil-A, according to a Rockmart Police arrest report obtained by news outlets.

Employees at the restaurant told investigators that Ragsdale showed up at the location multiple times during the week and posed as a federal agent while driving a white minivan, and also threatened to take employees into custody if they didn’t comply, the police report said.

It added that the woman continued the farce as police arrived to arrest her in the restaurant parking lot Thursday, reportedly claiming to officers that she was an FBI agent and that her credentials were electronic. While being handcuffed, she allegedly began to “talk into her shirt like she was talking into a radio telling someone that we were arresting her and to send someone to Rockmart PD,” officers wrote in the arrest report.

“You will not hear a real officer demand a meal anywhere,” Chief Randy Turner told news outlets. “If it is given, we appreciate it. If it is discounted, we appreciate it. We will not ask for it or make threats and demand it.”

Ragsdale was booked into jail Thursday and released on $3,000 bond by Saturday, online jail records showed.

It was not immediately clear whether the woman had an attorney who could comment for her.",['https://apnews.com/article/woman-posing-as-fbi-for-free-fast-food-ecf80718c6f2218e7a4a3c58aa42da8e'],33.9153,-84.8416
