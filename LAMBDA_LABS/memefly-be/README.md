# API Documentation

#### Backend delpoyed at [coming soon!](https://www.google.com/) <br>

## Getting started

prerequisite enviornment variables
- you need a .env file containing a  ```PRIVATE_KEY``` for jwt signing 

Setup for development 
- Clone this repo
- **npm i** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run dev ** to start the local server

### NodeJS + GraphQL + Mongodb/mongoose as ORM

Why I chose this stack

-    Easy to setup and "get going"
-    I wanted to learn GraphQL
-    I wanted to learn MongoDB

## Endpoints
```http://localhost:5000/account```


#### User Queries and Mutations
## All mutations and some queries respond with some form of a boolean
- ```register(username:"example", email:"example@example.com", password:"Password1234!"){ message created }```

- ```login(username:"example", email:"example@example.com", password:"Password1234!"){ loggedIn message token }```

  - login query requires either username or email it will default to email if both are in the body.<br>
    it will respond with a token but will also set token in set-cookies

- ```searchAccount(username:"abc"){username followers following}```
  - searchAccount brings back the accounts along with user details by a regular expresion match of the input limited to 30.
  
- ```update(key:"password", newValue:"NewPass1234!", oldValue:"Password1234!" ) { updated message }```
   - updates user info only the password key requires an oldValue.
   - Accepted keys are:
      - password
      - username
      - email
      
- ```myAccount(username,email){ message account{ username email } status}```
  - returns current user username and or email.
  
- ```follow(username:"someone"){ message followed }```
  - follows someone by username.
  
- ```unfollow(username:"someone"){ message unfollowed }```
  - unfollows someone by username.
  
## Using the testAccount api located in ```src/models/__tests__/utils/testAccount.ts```
#### creating new users on the fly:
- using valid
    - ```var test = testAccount()```<br>
      ```test.username = {type:"valid"} //this will generate a new valid username and sets it to the test object```<br>
      ```test.email = {type:"valid"} //this will generate a new valid email and sets it to the test object```<br>
      ```test.password = {type:"valid", length:16} //this will generate a new valid password and sets it to the test object it will also give it a length of 16```<br>
- using invalid
    - ```var test = testAccount()```<br>
      username by default will always be valid even when type invalid is set so you must use a postfix or prefix to get your desired result <br>
      ```test.username = {type:"invalid"} //this will generate a new invalid username and sets it to the test object```<br>
      ```test.email = {type:"invalid"} //this will generate a new invalid email and sets it to the test object```<br>
      ```test.password = {type:"invalid"} //this will generate a new invalid password and sets it to the test object```<br>
- using prefix / postfix
    - prefix / postfix will only work with an invalid type of testAccount  property <br>
    - ```var test = testAccount()```<br>
    ```test.username = {type:"invalid", postfix:"-"} //this will generate a new invalid username that ends with a dash and sets it to the test object```<br>
    ```test.email = {type:"invalid", prefix:"_"} //this will generate a new invalid email that begins with an underscore and sets it to the test object```<br>
- using custom properties
    - of course you can always just set your own property value<br>
    - ```var test = testAccount()```<br>
    ```test.username = "example"```<br>
    ```test.email = "example@example.com"```<br>
    ```test.password = "Password1234"```<br>
