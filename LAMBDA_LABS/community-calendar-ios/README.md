There is a disconnect between event organizers and community members. From the perspective of organizers, it can be difficult to get the word out about an event to each of the members of a community. From the perspective of community members, it can be challenging to find out about all the events going on in your neighborhood. Community Calendar was created to bridge that gap. Now anyone with a mobile phone can be alerted of events going on in their area.

The app is divided into three different tabs: home, where you can find events tailored for you and search for specific events by name, distance, interest, category, and more; events, where you will see your RSVP'd events along with a full list of events in your area; and profile, where you are able to log in or sign up, view your favorited events, set a profile picture, and edit your information like name, email, etc.
