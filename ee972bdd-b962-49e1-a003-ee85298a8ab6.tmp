Follow this guide to use the Firebase JavaScript SDK in your web app or as a client for end-user access, for example, in a Node.js desktop or IoT application.

## **Step 1**: Create a Firebase project and register your app

Before you can add Firebase to your JavaScript app, you need to create a Firebase project and register your app with that project. When you register your app with Firebase, you'll get a Firebase configuration object that you'll use to connect your app with your Firebase project resources.

Visit [Understand Firebase Projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0) to learn more about Firebase projects and best practices for adding apps to projects.

#### **Create a Firebase project**

1.  In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0), click **Add project**, then select or enter a **Project name**.
    
    If you have an existing Google Cloud project, you can select the project from the dropdown menu to add Firebase resources to that project.
    
2.  _(Optional)_ If you are creating a new project, you can edit the **Project ID**.
    
    Firebase automatically assigns a unique ID to your Firebase project. Visit [Understand Firebase Projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id) to learn about how Firebase uses the project ID.
    
3.  Click **Continue**.
    
4.  _(Optional)_ Set up Google Analytics for your project, which enables you to have an optimal experience using any of the following Firebase products:
    
    When prompted, select to use an existing [Google Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009618?ref_topic=3544906&authuser=0) or to create a new account.  
    If you choose to create a new account, select your [Analytics reporting location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations?authuser=0), then accept the data sharing settings and Google Analytics terms for your project.
    
5.  Click **Create project** (or **Add Firebase**, if you're using an existing Google Cloud project).
    

Firebase automatically provisions resources for your Firebase project. When the process completes, you'll be taken to the overview page for your Firebase project in the Firebase console.

#### **Register your app**

After you have a Firebase project, you can register your web app with that project.

1.  In the center of the [Firebase console's project overview page](https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0), click the **Web** icon () to launch the setup workflow.
    
    If you've already added an app to your Firebase project, click **Add app** to display the platform options.
    
2.  Enter your app's nickname.  
    This nickname is an internal, convenience identifier and is only visible to you in the Firebase console.
    
3.  Click **Register app**.
    
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to add and initialize the Firebase SDK in your app.
    
    You can also find more detailed instructions for adding, initializing, and using the Firebase SDK in the next steps of this getting started page.
    

If you don't already have a JavaScript project and just want to try out a Firebase product, you can download one of our [quickstart samples](https://firebase.google.com/docs/samples?authuser=0).

## **Step 2**: Install the SDK and initialize Firebase

This page describes setup instructions for version 9 of the Firebase JS SDK, which uses a [JavaScript Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) format.

This workflow uses npm and requires module bundlers or JavaScript framework tooling because the v9 SDK is optimized to work with [module bundlers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/module-bundling?authuser=0) to eliminate unused code (tree-shaking) and decrease SDK size.

1.  Install Firebase using npm:
    
    npm install firebase
    
2.  Initialize Firebase in your app and create a Firebase App object:
    
    import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';// TODO: Replace the following with your app's [Firebase project configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more?authuser=0#config-object)  
    const firebaseConfig \= {  //...  
    };const app \= initializeApp(firebaseConfig);  
    
    A Firebase App is a container-like object that stores common configuration and shares authentication across Firebase services. After you initialize a Firebase App object in your code, you can add and start using Firebase services.
    

## **Step 3**: Access Firebase in your app

Firebase services (like Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Realtime Database, Remote Config, and more) are available to import within individual sub-packages.

The example below shows how you could use the Cloud Firestore Lite SDK to retrieve a list of data.

import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';  
import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore/lite';  
// Follow this pattern to import other Firebase services  
// import { } from 'firebase/<service>';// TODO: Replace the following with your app's [Firebase project configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more?authuser=0#config-object)  
const firebaseConfig \= {  //...  
};const app \= initializeApp(firebaseConfig);  
const db \= getFirestore(app);// Get a list of cities from your databaseasync function getCities(db) {  const citiesCol \= collection(db, 'cities');  const citySnapshot \= await getDocs(citiesCol);  const cityList \= citySnapshot.docs.map(doc \=> doc.data());  return cityList;  
}  

## **Step 4**: Use a module bundler (webpack/Rollup) for size reduction

The Firebase Web SDK is designed to work with module bundlers to remove any unused code (tree-shaking). We strongly recommend using this approach for production apps. Tools such as the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), or [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) automatically handle module bundling for libraries installed through npm and imported into your codebase.

See our guide [Using module bundlers with Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/module-bundling?authuser=0) for more information.

## Available Firebase services for web

Now that you're setup to use Firebase, you can start adding and using any of the following available Firebase services in your web app.

## Next steps

**Learn about Firebase:**

-   Explore [sample Firebase apps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/samples?authuser=0).
    
-   Get hands-on experience with the [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/?authuser=0).
